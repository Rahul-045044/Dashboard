    "#While interpreting the Education category we can see that the distribution is skewed to the right, indicating that most apps in this category have relatively smaller sizes. The majority fall within 10-30 MB, with a long tail extending towards larger sizes.\n",
    "#The highest frequency of apps is concentrated around 15-20 MB, suggesting this is a common size range for educational apps.\n",
